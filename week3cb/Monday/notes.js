// LEARNING DOM 

// Only one body within your HTML



//document.body lets you access the body element

//id in HTML is like a social security number and you use it with buttons. 

//the .getelement_____ all of these will return an array 

let saveButton = document.getElementById('saveButton')
//

// This is how you'll access an element by id

//CLASS IS ONLY USED FOR STYLING 

//in the addEventListener the first parameter has to be an event. We don't use "on" like we do in html

//anonomys functions don't have a name EX: .function()

// the value between the opening and closing tags of an html element is called "innerHTML"

//text.value will give you the value inside the text box

//you can use <h1><h1> in HTML to display the title

//THIS IS THE HTML FOR THE FIRST ACTIVITY

// .appenchild is going to add an HTML element to another hTML element. This is what applies the imag src to actually show
